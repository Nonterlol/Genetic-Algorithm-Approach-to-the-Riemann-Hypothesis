# Fitness Function Design for Riemann Hypothesis

This document outlines the design of the fitness function for evaluating potential solutions to the Riemann Hypothesis in our genetic algorithm approach.

## Fitness Function Overview

The fitness function is crucial for guiding the evolutionary process toward expressions that might prove or provide insights into the Riemann Hypothesis. Our fitness function will be multi-objective, combining several metrics to evaluate different aspects of candidate expressions.

## Primary Evaluation Components

### 1. Critical Line Accuracy

This component evaluates how well the expression supports the Riemann Hypothesis by checking if non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part 1/2.

```python
def critical_line_accuracy(expression):
    # Sample a set of known non-trivial zeros of the zeta function
    zeros = sample_zeta_zeros(n=100)
    
    # Check if expression correctly predicts real part = 1/2 for these zeros
    accuracy = 0
    for zero in zeros:
        predicted_value = expression.evaluate(zero)
        # Measure how close the prediction is to confirming the hypothesis
        accuracy += measure_critical_line_confirmation(predicted_value, zero)
    
    return normalize(accuracy)
```

### 2. Mathematical Consistency

This component checks if the expression maintains mathematical consistency and doesn't contradict established principles.

```python
def mathematical_consistency(expression):
    # Check for basic mathematical properties that must be satisfied
    consistency_score = 0
    
    # Test functional equation of zeta function
    consistency_score += test_functional_equation(expression)
    
    # Test behavior at trivial zeros
    consistency_score += test_trivial_zeros(expression)
    
    # Test other known properties of zeta function
    consistency_score += test_zeta_properties(expression)
    
    return normalize(consistency_score)
```

### 3. Generality

This component assesses if the expression applies generally, not just to specific cases.

```python
def generality(expression):
    # Test expression on zeros not used in training
    validation_zeros = get_validation_zeros()
    
    # Test expression on different regions of the critical strip
    critical_strip_points = sample_critical_strip_points()
    
    # Combine scores from different tests
    generality_score = test_on_validation_zeros(expression, validation_zeros)
    generality_score += test_on_critical_strip(expression, critical_strip_points)
    
    return normalize(generality_score)
```

### 4. Expression Complexity

This component penalizes overly complex expressions to favor simpler, more elegant solutions.

```python
def complexity_penalty(expression):
    # Calculate complexity based on tree size, depth, and operation types
    node_count = expression.count_nodes()
    tree_depth = expression.depth()
    operation_complexity = calculate_operation_complexity(expression)
    
    # Combine metrics with appropriate weights
    complexity = (w1 * node_count + w2 * tree_depth + w3 * operation_complexity)
    
    # Return penalty (higher complexity = lower fitness)
    return normalize_penalty(complexity)
```

### 5. Novelty

This component rewards expressions that explore different approaches than the current population.

```python
def novelty(expression, population):
    # Calculate distance to nearest neighbors in population
    distances = []
    for individual in population:
        distances.append(calculate_expression_distance(expression, individual))
    
    # Average distance to k-nearest neighbors
    k = min(15, len(distances))
    nearest_distances = sorted(distances)[:k]
    novelty_score = sum(nearest_distances) / k
    
    return normalize(novelty_score)
```

## Combined Fitness Function

The overall fitness function combines these components with adjustable weights:

```python
def calculate_fitness(expression, population):
    # Calculate individual components
    accuracy = critical_line_accuracy(expression)
    consistency = mathematical_consistency(expression)
    gen = generality(expression)
    complexity = complexity_penalty(expression)
    nov = novelty(expression, population)
    
    # Combine with weights
    fitness = (
        w_accuracy * accuracy +
        w_consistency * consistency +
        w_generality * gen -
        w_complexity * complexity +
        w_novelty * nov
    )
    
    return fitness
```

## Adaptive Weighting

The weights of different components will adapt during evolution:

1. **Early Generations**: Higher weights on novelty and lower penalties for complexity to encourage exploration
2. **Middle Generations**: Balanced weights to refine promising approaches
3. **Late Generations**: Higher weights on accuracy and consistency to fine-tune solutions

```python
def update_weights(generation, max_generations):
    progress = generation / max_generations
    
    # Adjust weights based on evolutionary progress
    w_accuracy = 0.3 + 0.4 * progress
    w_consistency = 0.2 + 0.3 * progress
    w_generality = 0.2
    w_complexity = 0.1 + 0.2 * progress
    w_novelty = 0.3 - 0.2 * progress
    
    return w_accuracy, w_consistency, w_generality, w_complexity, w_novelty
```

## Special Fitness Bonuses

Additional bonuses will be awarded for expressions that achieve specific milestones:

1. **Proof Structure Bonus**: Expressions that follow a logical proof structure
2. **Novel Insight Bonus**: Expressions that reveal previously unknown patterns
3. **Simplicity Breakthrough Bonus**: Unexpectedly simple expressions with high accuracy

```python
def apply_special_bonuses(expression, fitness):
    # Check for proof structure
    if has_proof_structure(expression):
        fitness *= 1.5
    
    # Check for novel insights
    if provides_novel_insight(expression):
        fitness *= 1.3
    
    # Check for simplicity breakthroughs
    if is_simple_but_accurate(expression):
        fitness *= 2.0
    
    return fitness
```

## Fitness Evaluation Optimization

To make fitness evaluation computationally efficient:

1. **Caching**: Cache evaluation results for expressions and subexpressions
2. **Early Termination**: Stop evaluation early for clearly poor expressions
3. **Parallel Evaluation**: Distribute fitness calculations across multiple cores
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simple tests, only apply complex tests to promising candidates

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement core fitness components
2. Develop test suite for fitness function validation
3. Implement adaptive weighting system
4. Add special bonus detection
5. Optimize for computational efficiency

This fitness function design provides a comprehensive evaluation framework to guide the genetic algorithm toward potential solutions to the Riemann Hypothesis.
